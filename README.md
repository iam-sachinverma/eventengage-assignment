Sure, here's a sample README.md file that explains how to run a Next.js 13 app locally and how to deploy it to Vercel:

# Next.js 13 App

This is a sample Next.js 13 app.

## Running the app locally

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js 16 or later on your machine if you haven't already done so.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-app.git
   ```

3. Change into the project directory.

   ```
   cd nextjs-app
   ```

4. Install the app's dependencies.

   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the development server.

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

## Deploying the app to Vercel

To deploy the app to Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Create an account on Vercel if you haven't already done so.

2. Install the Vercel CLI by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

3. Log in to Vercel by running the following command and following the prompts:

   ```
   vercel login
   ```

4. Change into the project directory.

   ```
   cd nextjs-app
   ```

5. Deploy the app to Vercel by running the following command and following the prompts:

   ```
   vercel deploy
   ```

   This will deploy the app to a unique URL on Vercel, which you can access in your web browser.

That's it! You now know how to run a Next.js 13 app locally and how to deploy it to Vercel.
